Exploration of the data from Dupas (2014) available at https://sites.google.com/view/pascaline-dupas/research?authuser=0

- The paper is based on RCT that was carried out in 6 Kenyan villages and consisted in randomly assigning different subsidised prices for anti-malarial bed nets to 1200 households (that could collect the subsidised nets from a local retailer)
- Since the distribution of vouchers that gave the right to the subsidised price was carryed out from April until October 2007, a concern could be that villages were not randomly subject to malaria exposure, information spillover and health spillover
  - Assuming the voucher distribution happened village by village and that there can be information spillover between villages (distances varied from 10 to 50 km, which is quite a lot but not necessarily irrelevant), the last villages receiving bed nets might have been subject to more information spillover compared to villages that received them earlier, since by that time the other villages were already treated
  - The same concept applies to health spillover, in certain conditions the mosquitos present there can fly up to 12 km, hence reaching other nearby villages and affecting randomization (Mustapha et al. 2021; Nicholas et al. 2021; Kaufmann & Briegel, 2020)
  - Finally, an 11 years study made in a close-by area showed that April and August are the months with the most cases of malaria reported (Maniga et al.,2022), hence the timing of treatment might have affected randomization
- Unfurtunately, as a variable that tells when the voucher was delivered does not exist, it is hard to verify the above conjectures. Though, vilages average time to redeem the voucher differs significantly (52, 38, 33, 25, 8 and 7 days) and the purchase rate does too (about 0.3, 0.3, 0.45, 0.45, 0.7, 0.7)
