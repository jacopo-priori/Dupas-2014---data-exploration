Exploration on the data present on Pascaline Dupas' website regarding her 2014 paper "SHORT-RUN SUBSIDIES AND LONG-RUN ADOPTION OF NEWHEALTH PRODUCTS: EVIDENCE FROM A FIELD EXPERIMENT"

- The RCT was carried out on 6 villages in Kenya and consisted in randomly assigning different subsidised bed nets prices to 1200 households that could then chose to collect the net from a local retailer
- As the distribution of vouchers (that gave the right to the subsidised price) was carryed out from April until October of 2007, a concern could be that being subject to information spillover and health spillover is not randomized, and that exposure to malaria is not too.
  - Assuming the voucher distribution happened village by village and that there can be information spillover between villages (distances varied from 10 to 50 km, which is quite a lot but not necessarily irrelevant), the first village receiving bed nets might have been subject to less information spillover compared to the last village that received them, as by that time the other villages were already treated
  - The same concept applies to health spillover, in certain conditions the mosquitos present there can fly up to 12 km, hence reaching other nearby villages and affecting randomization
  - Finally, an 11 years study made in a close-by area showed that April and August are the months with the most cases of malaria reported, making the timing of treatment relevant
- Unfurtunately, as a variable that tells when the voucher was given does not exist the doubt about randomization to malaria exposure cannot be somehow verified. Further, the observations of the variable 'timetoredeem1' are present only for two villages out of six, hence it is quite hard to verify both the spillover randomization doubts 
- Quite uselessly (it is slightly relevant as they only had two months two collect the net, and considering an hypothetical 6 months difference this can still tell something) I checked if  the purchase rate varied between villages with the idea of finding same rates among close villages and different ones among distant ones (as for the adoption rate half of the obs. are missing too). Purchase rates vary from 30% to 70%. Out of the two pairs of villages that can be considered close in one the rate is both 40%, while in the other they are actually 30% and 70%. Hence, after this incredibly quick exploration, no conclusion can be drawn due to missing variables/observations.
